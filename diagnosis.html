			const strokeDsc = "With the symptoms you listed, it is clear that you experienced a stroke recently. Your symptoms, with proper treatment, will probably get better over time. Luckily, the worst is over, but you may have to deal with annoying family members harping on you about their worry."

Please visit a doctor to receive the exact specifications, but we urge you to take the utmost care of yourself over the next few days, as you are at higher risk of a heart attack."

Taken care of, this condition is not deadly, and you will see minimal changes to your overall life. Contact us at cure@yahoodoctor.com or visit your local doctor to find out how you can treat your symptoms."

			const covidDsc = "Most cases of Covid-19 do not end up being extremely serious, but you should stay at home and not contact anyone for the next couple of weeks. If your symptoms become worse, contact help@yahoodoctor.com or seek out a local doctor. Please know that we are having a cruel laugh at your expense at the moment; like how do you catch covid this late in the pandemic?"

Yahoo Doctor is not liable for your choice to believe us, and we will warn you that nobody has ever won a lawsuit against us because we failed to find whatever wacky thing was wrong with them."
