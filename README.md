# shakespeares-revenge
This is a website project repository for Advanced Computer Programming. The intention is to design a website using HTML and CSS about Shakespeare and the use of insults in his plays, and integrate a JavaScript program that will generate insults based on user-inputted parameters (for instance, they want the insult to involve the recipient being stupid and childish)
