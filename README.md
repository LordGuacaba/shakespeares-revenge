This is a website project repository for Advanced Computer Programming. The intention is to design a website using HTML and CSS for a fake website that makes fun of Yahoo and internet medical sites. It will incorporate 2-3 main website pages along with a tie-in to a JavaScript program that will produce bogus medical diagnoses based on symptoms that users can input through an html form.
